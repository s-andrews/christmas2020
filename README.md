Happy Christmas 2020
====================

As a year 2020 sucked pretty hard, but happy Christmas from Babraham Bioinformatics anyway!

Running the code
----------------
To run the ```christmas2020.R``` code you will need to install some packages if you don't have them already

```
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("bioseq")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggpubr")
library(devtools)
install_github("s-andrews/sangr")
```
To generate the card image you can then either run ```christmas2020.R``` in an interactive program such as RStudio, or you can generate the image on the command line by running:

```Rscript christmas2020.R```

What is this anyway??
---------------------
The image on this year's card is a simulation of a Sanger sequencing trace.  Each peak denotes the presence of a single DNA base.  The DNA sequence is grouped into triplets, called codons, and each codon encodes one amino acid in a protein sequence.  The amino acids can be represented by a single letter code, so if you read the traces, and then translate them into protein it spells our HAPPY CHRISTMAS.

The simulated chromatograms are generated by an R package which is used as an example in our new R Package Writing Course which will be available in 2021!
