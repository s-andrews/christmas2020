Running the code
----------------
To run the christmas2020.R code you will need to install some packages if you don't have them already

```
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("bioseq")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggpubr")
library(devtools)
install_github("s-andrews/sangr")
```
To generate the card image you can then either run ```christmas2020.R``` in an interactive program such as RStudio, or you can generate the image on the command line by running:

```Rscript christmas2020.R```
